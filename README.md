# EcoPerceiver

EcoPerceiver is a multimodal model based on the Perceiver architecture and built to predict carbon fluxes from biophysical data. We present EcoPerceiver as a baseline model for the CarbonSense dataset in our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04940).

EcoPerceiver was developed as a part of the IVADO AI, Biodiversity, and Climate Change initiative.

## Use

EcoPerceiver is published under the CC-BY 4.0 license and is free for any use including commercial. However, please note that this is research code and not production code. EcoPerceiver should not be used in a production environment without an extensive code and use-case review.

For instructions on using EcoPerceiver with the CarbonSense dataset, please see the guide [here](https://github.com/mjfortier/CarbonSense/tree/main/experiments).
